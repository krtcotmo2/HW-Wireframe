Three versions of the homework assignments.

index.htm is the basic portion of the positioning layout assignment.

adv1.html, adv2.html and adv3.html is the recommended assignment. This appears to be a basic template for a portfolio site. I worked in the extra features such as the fixed position navigation bar and footer. Added transition animations for the portfolio section pages. The variable widths and simpler layout made the responsive design much easier to make.

cubist.html, cubist2.html, cubist3.html has taken a more ambitious approach to a portfolio site. There is much more relative and absolute positioning with precise width and heights of container elements. This design took more planning since the order of the elements listed in the html had different emphasis for the desktop and mobile versions. The precise measurements also made the responsive design trickier. The navigation ended up far down in the stack of elements but needed to shift to the top of the page for the mobile version.
