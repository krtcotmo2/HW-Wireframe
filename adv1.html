                <p><img src="images/kurt.jpg">I love building things, things that have impact and make a difference. I work on cross-functional teams to discover underlying issues with business needs, offer creative solutions for solving them and work with the end use to design and build an effective and efficient UI for a good user experience.</p>
                <p>I have been working with web techniques for over a decade. I build simple web pages, to data rich dynamic dashboards to full blown internet applications. I have a strong grasp on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and .net. I have built relational databases in SQL, consumed REST services and created custom web services to process information. Managed 30+ SharePoint site collections with permissions, forms, workflows and design.</p>
                <p>I am a fast learner and love new challenges.</p>
